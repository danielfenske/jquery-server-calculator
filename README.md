# Server Calculator

## Description

The Server Calculator is an application that functions as a simple calculator. Its purpose it to take a set of inputs and order of operation, calculate its request, store the information on the server, and return the calculation with its solution. 

### Duration 

The total duration of the project was roughly ~16 hours. 

### What problem was solved? 

The task at hand was to create an application that correctly computed two inputs and a selected simple operation (add, subtract, multiply or divide).

I solved this problem by breaking the large task into smaller, more digestible action-items. This allowed me to focus on one thing at a time to ensure easy code readability and testability before integrating more variables. Below is a quick list on the steps I took to ensure project satisfaction:

- Develop a project plan by outlining needs of the application
- Make a list of actionable items to execute and connect them to their corresponding file
- Produce framework for application and write structural code within index.html file
- Connect client.js with server.js to ensure they are working together properly
- Begin building out a set of functions for one order of operation (addition) and testing its results
- Build client.js and server.js functions side by side as they related to one another
- Implement functionality that correctly received all orders of operations
- Consider possibilities for 'bad data' and insert conditionals for input fields to ensure all data needs are being fulfilled
- Integrate jQuery within client.js functions to receive calculation history and latest solution to append to DOM
- Refine the overall look of the application within style.css file
